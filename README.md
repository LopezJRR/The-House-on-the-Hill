# The Last House on the Hill
 Milestone Project 1

The purpose of this game is to provide me, the creater, with the opportunity to practice and implement the skills that I have been exposed to thus far in the Full Stack Development Bootcamp. 

Game Description

The player will navigate through options in order to survive the night in a haunted house. The night is devided into 2 five hour rounds of time in which the player must answer questions to navigate the character towards the exit. Each round will last exactly five minutes. 

As the player interacts with the game, the character's heartrate will increase. Be careful because if the heartrate gets too high, the character will experience cardiac death! 

The player will have opportunities to help calm the character at the risk of losing precious time!
